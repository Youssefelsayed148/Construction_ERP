## 2026-10-03: queued item 4, role-based project page (Phase 6 item, first slice)

Frontend stack (off the L3 shell branch, because it needs the L1-L3 catalog): PR base is `phase-10-l3-shell`.

- `ProjectShell` layout route at `/projects/:id`: six groups (Overview, Scope & Planning, Site & Quality, Procurement & Cost, Documents & Reports, Handover & Sales) with the active group's sub-tabs. The 13 hard-coded buttons in ProjectDetail are gone; all 13 sub-page URLs still work.
- One visibility map in `utils/projectNav.js` (spec role keys plus `site_supervisor`, `purchasing_mgr`; unknown or legacy roles see everything, `engineer` untouched). Contract value, budget and finance cards show only where the role has the procurement and cost group. Units & Sales only for residential, commercial, mixed projects (one constant to change). Presentation only: no backend check removed.
- All labels are catalog keys (`projects.nav.*`, EN and AR). 13 inline branches removed; i18n baseline regenerated (went down).
- Tests: `projectNav.test.js` (22: matrix per role, legacy mapping, type gating), `ProjectShell.test.js` (5: rendered tabs per role), Playwright `project-page.spec.js` (3 x desktop and mobile: owner, site engineer, Arabic RTL). Whole frontend suite 65/65.
- Not done (left open in the plan): count badges, "needs attention" list, spec 30 record layout, permission-driven path, `hidden group => 403` tests.
- Open questions: (1) `equipment_manager` sees Overview only because no equipment sub-page exists yet; (2) unit-selling project types are my assumption.
