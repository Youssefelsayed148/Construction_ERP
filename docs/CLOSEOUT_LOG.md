## 2026-10-03: queued item 1, upgrade preflight and data-cleaning report

- `scripts/preflight-upgrade.sql`: read-only report of what migrations 0001-0008 do to existing rows (written, unchanged, left NOT VALID, needs attention). Run on a restored copy before upgrading. On the throwaway database it runs and reports 13 rows.
- `services/dataCleaning.js` + `npm run data-cleaning-report`: for every NOT VALID CHECK or foreign key in the database, counts and samples the offending rows; never fixes; exit 2 when offenders exist. `validateConstraint` refuses while offenders remain. Generic, so future NOT VALID constraints (2.5, 2.6) are covered without registering them. This closes the plan's "validate the NOT VALID constraints from 0007/0008" tracking item: they validate at migrate time on clean data, otherwise the report lists the rows.
- Tests: `data-cleaning.pg.test.js` (4, real PG): CHECK and FK offenders (NULL passes a CHECK, MATCH SIMPLE FK), read-only, validate refuses then succeeds.
- Open: none.

## 2026-10-03: queued item 2, work-orders unit-cost input removed

- Reproduced: the backend already ignored a client `unit_cost` (2.2, issue cost comes from the stock ledger), but the Issue Material modal still showed a Unit Cost input and posted it. A user typed a number that was silently discarded.
- Removed the input and the field from the request body; the materials table still shows the server-derived cost read-only. `WOMaterialFormModal` is exported for the test.
- Tests: `WorkOrderMaterialForm.test.js` (2, frontend): no unit-cost field; POST body has no `unit_cost`. Both fail on the previous modal.
- Open: none.
