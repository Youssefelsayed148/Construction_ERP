# Closeout state

Updated: 2026-10-13 (Africa/Cairo)

## Done

- On branch `closeout/batch-a-to-6`; the user-provided untracked `docs/CODEX_AUDIT_REPORT.md` remains untouched and untracked.
- Added root `AGENTS.md` conventions. Batch A security work A1–A9 is complete and passed its end-of-batch gates.
- A4 converted the audited state-changing route families to transaction-bound activity/policy audit writes, added a route-wide lint guard, and added audit failure-injection coverage.
- A1 delegation renewal/date handling fix: `dd268d4`.
- A5 finance posting typed errors and API contract assertions: `2d757b7`.
- A7 approval-limit actor FK restrictions with a forward migration: `80c9005`.
- Other Batch A slice commits are recorded in `git log` and `docs/CLOSEOUT_LOG.md` (A2/A3 webhook controls, A4 audit transaction work, A5 typed errors, A6 harness/migration inventory, A7 monetary limits, A8 Playwright, A9 security scan fixes).
- Batch A gates, freshly run 2026-10-13:
  - Backend mock: 48/48 suites, 969/969 tests.
  - Real PostgreSQL: 56/56 suites, 566/566 tests against disposable local Docker Postgres 16 (`construction_erp_test`, localhost port 55439); all migrations applied, including 0041.
  - `npm run lint:guards`: `lint-guards: ok`.
  - Frontend: 17/17 suites, 97/97 tests; `i18n:check ok`; production build compiled.
  - Playwright: 32 passed / 46 skipped (78 discovered). Real-backend seeded-user journeys and screenshot baselines are the skipped tests.
- Updated `docs/MIGRATIONS.md` and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` to the verified migration/code state.

## In progress

- Batch B1 Compose foundation is implemented and verified. Unique project `erp-closeout-pilot-20261013` is running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8090`; DB/API/frontend are healthy. Root `.env.docker` contains locally generated credentials and is git-ignored. Do not read or print it.
- B2 role/user staging seed is implemented and verified: 38 users across 33 canonical roles plus no-assignment/expired-assignment cases, requester/checker identities, three legacy workflow compatibility actors, and supplier/client seats. Passwords are in ignored root `.staging-users.json`; do not read or print them.
- B3 pilot procure-to-pay data is implemented and verified: 3 materials, two suppliers/six rates, cost codes, 1 warehouse, stock rows, and 3 BOQ lines totaling EGP 1,376,500. Re-run is idempotent.
- B4 smoke passed against `http://127.0.0.1:8090`: full API chain, RBAC, locale, upload scoping, journal/reconciliation, and logout revocation passed; 0 unbalanced chain entries and unchanged out-of-scope project data.
- Batches C–E and Phases 5.6–6 remain open. Finance signoff still requires the owner to confirm provisional chart-of-accounts mappings.

## Where work stopped

Batch A and B1–B4 are green. A local pg_dump restored into a temporary database with 305 tables, and that temporary database/dump were removed. B5 still needs its reproducible rehearsal script, migration dry-run, data-cleaning report, and before/after counts. Next implement B5/B6, then Batch C. Keep all targets local, do not read any `.env` file, and never use production-looking databases or external services. A second ignored file `backend/.env.docker` was accidentally created with only `CORS_ALLOW_HTTP_LOCAL=true`; an attempt to remove it was rejected by auto-review, so it remains unused and untouched.

## Current gates

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Backend mock (`npm test -- --runInBand`) | PASS — 48 suites / 969 tests |
| Real PG (`TEST_PG=1 npm run test:pg`) | PASS — 56 suites / 566 tests |
| Backend guards | PASS — `lint-guards: ok` |
| Frontend CI | PASS — 17 suites / 97 tests |
| i18n | PASS — `i18n:check ok` |
| Frontend production build | PASS — compiled successfully |
| Playwright | PASS — 32 passed / 46 skipped |
| Batch B1 image build / fresh Compose health | PASS — all 3 services healthy, localhost health ready |
| Batch B2 staging seed + guard/re-run assertions | PASS — 38 users including compatibility actors; guards verified |
| Batch B3 demo data | PASS — repeat seed stable; 3 BOQ items / EGP 1,376,500 |
| Batch B4 full smoke | PASS — all journey checkpoints; 0 unbalanced entries; token revoked |
| Batch B5 full rehearsal | PARTIAL — local dump restored successfully (305 tables); script/dry-run/data-cleaning/count checks remain |
| Batches C–E and Phases 5.6–6 | NOT RUN |

## Risks and decisions

- Production remains **NO-GO**; human UAT and owner finance account confirmation are not complete.
- Docker test execution needed elevated local-engine access because the sandbox could not access the Docker Desktop pipe. The test DB was isolated and named explicitly; no production-looking or external database was used.
- Approval limit defaults and finance mappings are provisional where noted in code/docs; finance signoff remains pending.
- `0030` remains a documented, unreused migration-number gap. Highest migration is `0041`; next is `0042`.
